## Introduction  

Based upon anecdotal evidence (personal experience), Dr. Franklund believes that there may be an association between the type of vehicle people drive with the liklihood that they will adorn that vehicle with window and/or bumper stickers. This brief project serves both to test that hypothesis and provide an opportunity to practice collecting and using "tidy" data.

100 cars were surveyed from the local area, and their make, type, and color were recorded, as well as whether they had a bumper sticker or not. Alternatively, the code in Generator.Rmd created Data.csv using simulated data.

## Procedure

```{r heyLookData, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
mrTibbles <- read_csv("Data.csv")

knitr::kable(mrTibbles %>% group_by(Make) %>% summarize(Number = n()) %>% arrange(desc(Number)), caption = "*Figure 1:* Vehicle Make Frequency") %>% kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "float_left")

knitr::kable(mrTibbles %>% group_by(Type) %>% summarize(Number = n()) %>% arrange(desc(Number)), caption = "*Figure 2:* Vehicle Type Frequency") %>% kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "float_left")

knitr::kable(mrTibbles %>% group_by(Color) %>% summarize(Number = n()) %>% arrange(desc(Number)), caption = "*Figure 3:* Vehicle Color Frequency")  %>% kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "left")
```

## Results

### Window/bumper sticker frequency compared to vehicle type

```{r type, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, fig.cap = "**Figure n:** Sticker Frequency by Vehicle Type"}
mrTibbles %>%
	select(Type, Sticker) %>%
	group_by(Type) %>%
	add_tally() %>%
	filter(Sticker) %>%
	add_tally(wt = Sticker) %>%
	distinct() %>%
	transmute(Type, SuperFreq = nn / n) %>%
	ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x = Type, y = SuperFreq), stat = "summary", fun = "mean", fill = c("#005333","#331166","#FF0000", "#664422")) + ylim(0,1) + labs(x = "Vehicle Type", y = "Sticker Frequency")
```

Words.

<!-- (7) Insert an R chunk here to perform a one-way ANOVA analysis comparing sticker presence vs. car type. --> 

```{r typeANOVA, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

### Window/bumper sticker frequency compared to vehicle make
<!-- (8) Insert an R chunk here to analyze and plot the portion of vehicles with stickers by make. -->

```{r make, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "**Figure n:** Sticker Frequency by Vehicle Make"}

### Window/bumper sticker frequency compared to vehicle color
<!-- (11) Insert an R chunk here to analyze and plot the portion of vehicles with stickers by color. -->
