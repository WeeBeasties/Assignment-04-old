## Introduction  
Based upon anecdotal evidence (personal experience), Dr. Franklund believes that there may be an association between the type of vehicle people drive with the liklihood that they will adorn that vehicle with window and/or bumper stickers. This brief project serves both to test that hypothesis and provide an opportunity to practice collecting and using "tidy" data.

<!-- (3) Briefly describe what data you collected, how, when, and where you collected it, and the file name and format of your dataset. -->
## Procedure  
I went outside in my apartment complex and walked around the parking lot to collect the data. It was around 6 at night when I collected the data. I wrote the data in an excel file I called Car Data. I then converted the file to csv file.

<!-- (4) Insert an R chunk here to load your dataset into a tibble --> 
```{r,echo=FALSE}
read.csv("CarInfo.csv")
```


## Results

### Window/bumper sticker frequency compared to vehicle type
<!-- (5) Insert an R chunk here to analyze and plot the portion of vehicles with stickers by type -->
```{r,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.cap=("__Figure 1__:Type vs Sticker Bar Plot")}
by_Sticker_Type <- read.csv("CarInfo.csv") %>% group_by(Sticker,Type) %>% summarize(Number = n()) %>% arrange(desc(Number))
knitr::kable(by_Sticker_Type) %>% kable_styling(full_width = F)
ggplot(by_Sticker_Type, aes(x=Type, y=Sticker))+ geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "summary", fun="mean")
```

The plot above shows shows how often cars of a certain type (Trucks,sedans etc.) had stickers on a window or a bumper. Sedans had the most stickers with 13. Below is an ANOVA analysis of those findings.

<!-- (6) Write a few sentences using markdown to summarize the plot above and the ANOVA analysis that follows. --> 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(anova(lm(Sticker ~ Type, data = read.csv("CarInfo.csv"))),
			 digits = 3, 
			 format = "html", 
			 caption = "__Figure 2__: Type vs Sticker Anova Analysis",
			 table.attr = "style='width:70%;'") %>% kable_styling(position = "center")
```

<!-- (7) Insert an R chunk here to perform a one-way ANOVA analysis comparing sticker presence vs. car type. --> 

### Window/bumper sticker frequency compared to vehicle make
<!-- (8) Insert an R chunk here to analyze and plot the portion of vehicles with stickers by make. -->
```{r,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.cap=("Figure 3: Make vs Sticker Plot")}
by_Sticker_Make <- read.csv("CarInfo.csv") %>% group_by(Sticker,Make) %>% summarize(Number = n()) %>% arrange(desc(Number))
knitr::kable(by_Sticker_Make) %>% kable_styling(full_width = F)
ggplot(by_Sticker_Make, aes(x=Make, y=Sticker))+geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "summary", fun="mean")
```

The plot above shows Car Make vs Sticker. Ford and Honda tied for the most stickers, with 5 each.  Below is an ANOVA anylysis of the same information.
<!-- (9) Write a few sentences using markdown to summarize the plot above and the ANOVA analysis that follows. --> 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(anova(lm(Sticker ~ Make, data = read.csv("CarInfo.csv"))),
			 digits = 3, 
			 format = "html", 
			 caption = "__Figure 4__: Make vs Sticker Anova Analysis",
			 table.attr = "style='width:70%;'") %>% kable_styling(position = "center")
```

<!-- (10) Insert an R chunk here to perform a one-way ANOVA analysis comparing sticker presence vs. car make. --> 

### Window/bumper sticker frequency compared to vehicle color
<!-- (11) Insert an R chunk here to analyze and plot the portion of vehicles with stickers by color. -->
```{r,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',fig.cap=("__Figure 5__:Color vs Sticker Plot")}
by_Sticker_Color <- read.csv("CarInfo.csv") %>% group_by(Sticker,Color) %>% summarize(Number = n()) %>% arrange(desc(Number))
knitr::kable(by_Sticker_Color) %>% kable_styling(full_width = F)
ggplot(by_Sticker_Color, aes(x=Color, y=Sticker))+ geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "summary", fun="mean")
```
This plot compared car color with having a sticker or not. In my findings white cars were the most likely to have stickers.Below is an ANOVa analysis of that information.

<!-- (12) Write a few sentences using markdown to summarize the plot above and the ANOVA analysis that follows. --> 
```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(anova(lm(Sticker ~ Color, data = read.csv("CarInfo.csv"))),
			 digits = 3, 
			 format = "html", 
			 caption = "__Figure 6__: Color vs Sticker Anova Analysis",
			 table.attr = "style='width:70%;'") %>% kable_styling(position = "center")
```

## Conclusions
<!-- (14) Wrap up your assignment with a brief discussion of what you found. Did you find any evidence to support Dr. Franklund's initial hypothesis? How do you interpret your findings? --> 
I didn't find any conclusive data that one's type of car correlates with them having a sticker. But from the data I collected Vans are much more like to have stickers on them then the other types. I think for more conclusive data I would need to see 25 vans,sedans, trucks,SuV's, etc and compare how many of each had stickers on them. The p value from my ANoVA analysis does give indication to reject the null hypothesis.
